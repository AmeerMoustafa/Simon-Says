## About:

The classic memory game with sound, animations and a high score now on the web. I really learned more about animating the DOM, cleaning event listeners when you're done with the them and a taste of what is possible with just a browser, HTML/CSS and JS.

## Features:

- A level system that makes the game progressively harder with time
- high score that is saved in localstorage
- fully functioning sound and animations.

## What I learned:

- Cleaning up event listeners after use is incredibly important
- Basics of localstorage
- Refactor, refactor, refactor
- A lot more practice on applying clean code principles and methodologies.
